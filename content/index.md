The objectives of this system are:
- The game can be played both with miniatures on a map, or entirely with theatre-of-the-mind.
- Magick is rare, difficult, dangerous, and feared.
- Combat is quick, deadly, dynamic, and full of tactical choices.
- A character's skill is more important than luck of the dice.
- The system favors complexity once (at character creation) rather than repeatedly during combat (e.g., in looking up modifiers to combat rolls).
- Allow a very quick and intuitive way of gauging the degree of success.
- Achieve a better balance between starting characters and existing characters. Even starting characters must be able to contribute to a veteran group.

The [[RulesSummary|summary]] page gives a quick overview of the rules.
