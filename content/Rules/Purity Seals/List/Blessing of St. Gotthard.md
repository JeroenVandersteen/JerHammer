### Blessing of St. Gotthard

_Absorb one hit_

The purity seal absorbs all damage and effects (e.g. conditions) of one hit. This may be a hit from an unarmed, melee or ranged attack; not from a spell. The attack has no effect on the wearer of the seal only. Any damage to allies or an area still has its original effect.
