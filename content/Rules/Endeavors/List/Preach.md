### Preach

**Prerequisite:** [[Impassioned zeal]] talent

_Create a following to be used ad hoc_

As per the talent, you may preach to the local community to gather their support for you or your cause. Somewhere in the next session, when it narratively makes sense (GM discretion), you call on a group of locals to support your actions in one scene. The number of supporters is equal to your Fellowship times the number of times you have taken this talent.
