### Prepare ritual spell

**Prerequisite:** [[Arcane Magick (Lore)]] talent

_Preload one ritual spell_

You may choose one spell that can be cast as a ritual. By performing the ritual, you may already channel the winds of magick into the spell, without casting it immediately. Instead, you can cast this spell as an action during the next session, without the need for a spellcast roll and without miscast roll. The spell still adds to the miscast tally.
