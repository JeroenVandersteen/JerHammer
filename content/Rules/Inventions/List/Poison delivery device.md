A poison reservoir is mounted inside the weapon. A dose of poison can be applied to the weapon's sharp edge on the press of a button (free action), which then applies the effect of the poison on the next successful attack. The reservoir holds 2 doses of the same poison. Unused poison may be wiped off, but cannot be recovered back into the reservoir.
