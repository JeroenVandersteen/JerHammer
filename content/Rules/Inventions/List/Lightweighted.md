### Lightweighted

**Target Item:** 1H Melee weapon

**Level:** 1

**Cost:** 6d

_Gain the light quality_

This weapon gains the light quality and can be used as offhand second weapon. However, this also reduces reach, so no longer breaks ties in melee combat. This cannot be applied to a weapon with the heavy quality or a two-handed weapon.
