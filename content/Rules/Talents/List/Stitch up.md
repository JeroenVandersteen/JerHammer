### Stitch up

_Advantage to remove bleeding_

You may spend full round stitching up bleeding wounds. You gain advantage on medicine tests to remove bleeding conditions of another character. You may stitch yourself up, but then you gain disadvantage on the medicine test, as you have to fight the pain. If successful, you may remove all bleeding conditions. If failed, you remove none.

**Without this talent:**
Spend a full round action and a normal medicine check to remove 1 bleeding condition from another character. During this round, both characters cannot take other actions. For every 2 points above the difficulty, remove an additional bleeding condition. On a failed check, no bleed condition has been removed.
