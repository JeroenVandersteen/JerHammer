_Can gather herbs_

You can use an endeavour to gather herbs up to a combined level of herbs equal to the number of times the talent was taken. Roll on the table of herbs randomly to determine which one(s) you find. You can call yourself apprentice (I), journeyman (II), master (III) or grandmaster (IV), depending on the number of times this talent was taken.
