### Consume alcohol

_Advantage when consuming alcohol_

You hold alcohol better than most people. You only need to make rolls when the GM calls for a specific difficult situation and then you gain advantage on endurance tests when checking for effects of consuming alcohol. The GM May additionally grant advantages when using this in roleplay situations, such as when trying to gain information in a tavern or trying to charm someone over drinks.
