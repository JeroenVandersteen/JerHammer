### Armorbreaker

_Destroy armor instead of crit damage_

When critically hitting an opponent with a weapon that has the armor destroying quality, you may choose to break their armor on top of dealing normal damage (not critical damage). The broken armor is reduced to zero armor points, and no longer provides impact reduction.
