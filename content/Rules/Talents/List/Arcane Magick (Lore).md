### Arcane Magick (Lore)
**Prerequisites:** Career

_Can cast arcane Magick_

You either study one of the 8 Arcane Lores of Magic — Beasts, Death, Fire, Heavens, Metal, Shadow, Light, or Life — or practice a lesser known Lore, such as Hedgecraft or Necromancy. You may now memorise spells from your chosen Lore for 100 XP. You may not learn the Bless or Invoke Talents when you have the Arcane Magic Talent. You can unlearn this Talent for 100 XP, but will immediately lose all of your spells if you do so.
