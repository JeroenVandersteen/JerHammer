### Blood lash
**Max:** WP

_Spend move and -1HP to cause bleed_

You chastise yourself and lash out in a fanatical fury at your opponent, creating a bloody mess of religious fervor. You may spend a move to chastise yourself with your melee weapon. Chastising causes 1 HP damage on yourself for each time you have taken this talent. For each HP you lose yourself, you deal an extra bleed condition (in addition to the normal damage) on your next successful melee attack. This is a divine effect.
