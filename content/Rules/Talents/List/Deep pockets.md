### Deep pockets

_Have simple items_

You carry around a number of small items, which may provide you with just the item you needed. Once per game session, you may pull one small, simple item which may fit in a pocket or backpack. The item cannot be a weapon, shield, piece of armor, or animal. It cannot be very expensive, and is subject to GM approval.
