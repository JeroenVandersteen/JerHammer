### Counterspell
**Prerequisites:** Career

_May defend against spells_

You may spend your next action to attempt to counter a spell that is being cast. If the attacking caster succeeds on their spellcast check, you may also make a spellcast test. If the result of your spellcast test is equal to or higher than the attacker's, the spell is countered and has no effect. Regardless of whether your attempt was successful, you lose your next action.
