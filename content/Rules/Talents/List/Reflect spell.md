### Reflect spell
**Prerequisites:** Counterspell

_May reflect spell back to caster_

You may spend your next action to attempt to counter and reflect a spell that is being cast. If the attacking caster succeeds on their spellcast check, you may also make a spellcast test. If the result of your spellcast test is equal to or higher than the attacker's, the spell is reflected back to the attacking caster as if you successfully cast the spell. You then increase your miscast tally by 1 and make a miscast test, as if you had cast the spell yourself. Regardless of whether your attempt was successful, you lose your next action.
