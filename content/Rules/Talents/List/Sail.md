### Sail

_Can use ships_

You know how to use and operate ships. For basic things (raising a sail, navigating a calm river, docking in a harbour,...) you do not need to make a test. The GM may ask for a test in difficult situations (e.g. sailing through a storm, navigating treacherous sand banks,...)
