**Max:** Int

_Medicine test and full round to heal 1 HP_

Choose a target to apply first aid on within 1 minute of sustaining damage. The target can also be yourself. Spend a full round and make medicine test. If successful, the target character heals 1 HP for each time you have taken this talent, and the target is also stabilized. If failed, the target loses 1 HP, regardless of the number of times the talent was taken. This can only be attempted once per character per combat.

**Without this talent:**
Without this talent, you cannot attempt to heal another character.
