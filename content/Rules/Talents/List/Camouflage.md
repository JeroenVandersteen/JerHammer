### Camouflage

_May hide a group of characters_

You may camouflage a group of people and hide small vehicles or objects. For each character or character-sized object, you need to spend 10 minutes creating a camouflage. For characters that are not specifically looking for the camouflaged subjects, the stealth attempt automatically succeeds. When characters are specifically on the lookout (e.g. guards that are on the lookout in a convoy) you gain advantage on stealth checks.
