### Advanced education

_Advanced math, science, literature_

You have a more advanced general education and have learnt to count and do advanced math, some notions of science, and literature. Some things you know without making a test, but the GM may call for an intelligence test if appropriate.

**Without this talent:**
Without this talent, characters have no advanced education, and thus no notions of mathematics, sciences, literature, and are not trained in critical thinking or research.
