_No sound/gestures on one spell_

Choose one spell. To cast that spell you only need small, subtle gestures (like some flicks of the fingers) and soft whispers. This makes that most people do not notice you are casting that spell, and that you can still cast this spell while restrained. You may take this talent multiple times. Every time you take the talent, you can choose a different spell.

**Without this talent:**
Without this talent, every spell requires both obvious gestures and audible verbal incantations to cast. You cannot cast spells while restrained.
