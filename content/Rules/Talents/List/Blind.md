### Blind

_Blind, but observant via sound_

You are permanently blind and have become very observant to sound and have developed a supernatural awareness. You automatically fail perception tests that rely on sight, cannot read (except texts that are based on relief such as engraved glyphs), and always have the blinded condition. You gain advantage on perception tests that rely on sounds or touch. You are able to move around at normal speed without bumping into people and objects.
