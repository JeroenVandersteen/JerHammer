_Spend endeavor to create purity seal(s)_

You may spend 1 endeavor to make 1 purity seal per time you have taken the write purity seal talent. You can choose any purity seal(s). You need to provide the tools and materials (wax, seal, parchment or cloth, ink, quill). The purity seal is a one-time use; and be used by anyone, not necessarily the creator (though the creator can certainly use their own seals). Seals can be passed on freely by whoever owns it.
