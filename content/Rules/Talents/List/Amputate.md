_Amputate limb to save from death_

You may make an ultimate attempt to save the life of an almost-dead character. You may spend a fortune point and 1 minute on a character that has died no longer than 5 minutes earlier. When you do so, make a medicine test. If successful, the character is alive and back at 1 HP, but you must permanently amputate 1 limb. If failed, the character is dead.
