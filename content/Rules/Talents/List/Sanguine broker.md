_Transfer HP from one to another_

You may spend 1 minute to attempt to transfer blood from one willing or restrained target to another creature. Make a medicine test. If successful, transfer 1 HP from the donating creature to the receiving creature. If failed, both loose 1d6 HP. Note that the donating creature must be at the same level on the food chain as the receiver. I.e. you cannot use an animal to heal a human. This is a divine effect.
