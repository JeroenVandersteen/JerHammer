### Briber

_Advantage on bribe_

You gain advantage when attempting to bribe someone. You still get to take 3 bribery tests in a bribery attempt as usual, but with advantage on each of the 3 tests.

**Without this talent:**
Without this talent, characters can try to bribe someone. The GM secretly writes down the NPC's price (everyone has a price). The bribing character can make 3 persuasion tests. With each successful test, he can name a price, and the GM states if the target is higher or lower. At the end, the character makes his final offer.
