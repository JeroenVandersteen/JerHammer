### Blather

_Opposed deception/logic to cause disadvantage_

You may attempt to blather and taunt one opponent. If you do so, you make an opposed deception/logic test. If successful, your opponent gets disadvantage to their next action. If failed, you cannot attempt this again on the same opponent, as they understood your technique.
