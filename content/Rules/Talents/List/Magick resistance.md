_Gain +1 Magick DC_

You are very resilient to magick; the winds of magick have a harder time flowing through you, and you are just not meant to cast spells. You gain a +1 on your magick DC per time you take this talent, but you suffer 1 disadvantage die per time you take this talent on checks to cast spells.
