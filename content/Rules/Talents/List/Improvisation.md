### Improvisation

_Use other skill if narrated_

You are good at improvising your way out of trouble, and using your strengths to your advantage. If narrated correctly, and if it makes sense in the context, you may use another skill instead of the normal skill for a test. This is up to GM's discretion. For example, when displaying your skill with the rapier, you may use your melee offense skill instead of persuasion to charm a noblewoman.
