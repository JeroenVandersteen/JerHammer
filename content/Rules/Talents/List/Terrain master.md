_Create cover, (dis)advantageous/difficult terrain_

You throw around furniture, pull a chandelier on the ground, knock over cupboards or bushes, spread vines and rocks, or reorganise the terrain around you to your advantage. For each full turn you spend doing this, you may, for example:
- create a 4x4 meter area of difficult terrain
- create cover for up to 2 characters
- create a patch of advantageous terrain the size of 1 character
- create a patch of disadvantageous terrain the size of 1 character
Given enough time (e.g. several minutes or more), you may create large areas of these terrain type, but not remodel entire structures. The terrain you create is ad hoc, improvised and temporary. There needs to be some material available to do this (e.g. furniture, rocks, branches and bushes, rubble,...) and you may require some tools (e.g. an axe if you need to cut down a tree).
