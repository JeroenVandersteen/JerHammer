### Cauterize

_Turn bleeding into wounds_

You may spend a full round closing any bleeding wounds with fire. Make a medicine test. If successful, you remove all bleeding conditions of one character, but they gain 1 wound per bleeding condition removed. If failed, you still remove all bleeding conditions of one character, but they gain 1d6 wounds per bleeding condition removed. You may cauterize yourself, but then you gain disadvantage on the medicine test, as you have to fight the pain.

**Without this talent:**
Spend a full round action and a normal medicine check to remove 1 bleeding condition from another character. During this round, both characters cannot take other actions. For every 2 points above the difficulty, remove an additional bleeding condition. On a failed check, no bleed condition has been removed.
