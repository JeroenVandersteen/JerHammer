### Menacing

_Advantage on intimidation_

You look menacing and dangerous. People generally get a little scared of you, e.g. strangers get intimidated when you walk into a tavern, and opponents may hesitate to attack you instead of a less menacing character. You gain advantage on leadership tests when intimidating.
