### Taunt

_Opposed test to force to attack you_

Select 1 opponent to taunt, insult and embarrass. You may make an opposed deception/intuition check. If successful, the selected opponent must move towards you and attempt to attack you, if able. If the opponent has a ranged weapon, they may choose to attempt to make a ranged attack instead. If failed, you may not attempt this again on the same opponent, as they stop listening your taunts.
