### Secret identity

_Have a secret identity/life_

You have built up a secret identity or a secret second life. Most people believe your secret identity to be true and act as such. You do not need to roll for deception or disguise tests in most circumstances when upholding your secret identity or public identity. The GM may still ask for a roll for very specific reasons.
