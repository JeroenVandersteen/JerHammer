### Lore

_Deep knowledge on subject_

You are well versed on the subject, and know most basic information on the subject without making a test. The GM may ask for a lore (Intelligence) test if the situation calls for it, in which case you gain advantage on your roll.. Example subjects are: history, religion, nobility, heraldry, science, warfare, technology, blackpowder weapons. The knowledge represents a purely theoretical knowledge.
