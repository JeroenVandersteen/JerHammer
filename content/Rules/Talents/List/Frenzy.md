_When frenzied, advantage to hit_

You can gain the frenzy condition voluntarily with this talent. Entering a frenzy is a free action. While frenzied, you gain advantage on melee attack rolls to hit. Opponents also gain advantage to hit you in melee combat. You can only stop your frenzy by stopping to fight. As long as you are fighting, you must maintain the frenzy. You gain 1 fatigue condition after the frenzy is over.
