### Animal training

_Can train animals_

You can turn an untrained animal into a trained animal when you take an endeavour; depending on which animal, and which type of training. You can make animals do more advanced things. E.g. you can train a bear to be a dancing bear, train a horse not to be skittish, train a wild falcon for hunting, train a dog to fetch keys. These are then commands that can be given to that specific animal, not all animals in general.
