### Animal affinity

_Animals do simple things_

You have an affinity for animals, and animals generally like you. Animals calm down in your presence; unless there is a reason why they would not calm down, such as an immediate threat when directly in combat. You can give simple instructions to animals, such as asking a dog to fetch something, command a guard dog not to bark, whistle to call a horse, use messenger pigeons and trained hunting falcons.
