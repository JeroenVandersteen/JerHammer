### Invoke (Divine Lore)
**Prerequisites:** Career

_Can use Miracles_

You are blessed by one of the Gods and can empower one of your Cultâ€™s Miracles. Further, you may purchase extra miracles for 100 XP per miracle you currently know. So, if you already know 3 miracles, your next miracle costs 300 XP to purchase. Under normal circumstances, you may not learn more than one Invoke (Divine Lore) Talent. Further, you may not learn the Petty Magic or Arcane Magic Talents when you have the Invoke Talent. You can unlearn this Talent for 100 XP, but will lose all of your miracles if you do so, and will also garner the extreme disfavour of your God, with effects determined by your GM.
