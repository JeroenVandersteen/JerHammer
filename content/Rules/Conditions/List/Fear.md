### Fear

_Run and hide_

•        You are afraid.
•        You must spend you full move running away from the source of your fear as fast as you can.
•        You cannot take any actions other than trying to hide.
•        Only if cornered with no way out, you may attack the source of your fear in melee combat, but with disadvantage to hit.
•        At the start of your turn, you may make a courage test. If successful, you may remove 1 fear condition. For every 2 points above the target number, remove an additional fear condition. On a failed check, no fear condition has been removed.
