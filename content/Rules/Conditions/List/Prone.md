### Prone

_Opp. gain adv in melee, disadv in ranged_

•        You are on the ground.
•        Opponents gain advantage on melee attack rolls against you.
•        Opponents gain disadvantage on ranged attack rolls against you, except if they are shooting you from above.
•        Getting up from prone costs half your move that turn.
