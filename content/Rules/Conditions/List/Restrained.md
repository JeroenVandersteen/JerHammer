### Restrained

_No move, no gestures. opp. gain adv, auto-crit_

•        You cannot move, and cannot make hand gestures (e.g. for casting spells).
•        Melee and ranged attacks on you get advantage, and automatically cause critical damage if hit.
•        You can escape the restrained condition by winning an opposed strength test against the source. In same cases the GM may allow an opposed acrobatics or sleight of hand vs strength test instead.
•        You may make one attempt at the start of your turn. This attempt costs half your move.
