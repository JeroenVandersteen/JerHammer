### Blinded

_Disadv on all tests that require vision_

•        You get disadvantage on combat rolls and on skill checks that rely on vision.
•        This condition may be permanent, or depending on the cause of this condition, there may be a way to remove it.
•        If this was caused by a short flash of light, remove one blinded condition at the end of the round.
