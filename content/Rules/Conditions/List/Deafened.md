### Deafened

_Disadv on all tests that require hearing_

•        You cannot perceive sound or noise.
•        You automatically fail perception checks if based on sound.
•        This condition may be permanent, or depending on on the cause of this condition, there may be a way to remove it.
•        If this was caused by a short bang, remove one deafened condition at the end of the round.
