### Bleeding

_1d6 L dam-turn, ignore AP_

•        You are bleeding out rapidly.
•        Each bleeding condition causes 1d6 lethal damage at the end of each round. This damage is not first subtracted from armor points.
•        Spend a full round action and a normal Intelligence (medicine) check to remove 1 bleeding condition from another character. During this round, both characters cannot take other actions. For every 2 points above the target number, remove an additional bleeding condition. On a failed check, no bleed condition has been removed.
•        With the stich up talent, you get advantage on the medicine check to remove bleeding conditions. You still can stich up yourself, but at disadvantage on the medicine check.
•        With the cauterize talent, you automatically remove all bleeding conditions. On a successful Intelligence (medicine) check, you deal 1 HP damage per bleeding condition removed. On a failed medicine check, you deal 1d6 damage per bleeding condition that was removed. You can cauterize yourself, but gain disadvantage on the medicine check.
