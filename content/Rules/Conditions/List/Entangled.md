### Entangled

_Cannot move_

•        You cannot move, but you can still take any action that does not require changing positions.
•        You can escape the entangled condition by winning an opposed strength test against the source. In some cases the GM may allow an opposed acrobatics or sleight of hand vs strength test instead.
•        You may make one attempt at the start of your turn. This attempt costs half your move.
