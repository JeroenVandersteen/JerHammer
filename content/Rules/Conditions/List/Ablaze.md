### Ablaze

_1d6 L dam-turn_

•        You are on Fire.
•        Each ablaze condition causes 1d6 fire damage (lethal) at the end of each round.
•        You may spend an action trying to put out the fire on yourself by rolling in the mud, or by putting out the flames on another character. Make an athletics or acrobatics test. If successful, remove 1 ablaze condition. For every 2 points above the target number, remove an additional ablaze condition. On a failed check, no ablaze condition has been removed.
