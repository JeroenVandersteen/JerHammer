### Unstable

_Make endurance test or die, every turn_

•        You are at zero hit points and at the edge between life and death.
•        At the start of your turn, you make a Toughness (Endurance) test. If you fail the test, you are dead.
•        If you take any damage while unstable, you gain a critical wound. Roll on the critical wound table.
•        Whenever you are healed 1 or more hit points, you lose the unstable condition.
