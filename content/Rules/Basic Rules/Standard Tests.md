### Standard Tests

To make a test, roll 3d6 and add the relevant attribute and skill. A higher result is better. If your result is equal to or higher than the Target Number (TN) of the test, you succeed. Unless otherwise specified, the default target number of a test is 15. For particularly easy or hard tasks, the TN is modified by 2, as in the table below.


| TN  | Difficulty | 
| --- | ---------- |
| 13  | Easy       |
| 15  | Normal     |
| 17  | Hard       |

Most often it does not matter by how much the results exceeds the TN. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to assess by how much the TN is exceeded. The difference between the test result and TN is the number of _success levels_ scored.
